        <p class="text-base">Ocean literacy involves understanding our influence on the ocean and the ocean's influence on us. When people understand these connections, they're more likely to make informed and responsible decisions regarding ocean resources and conservation efforts.</p>
        
        <p class="text-base">Education creates a ripple effect: informed individuals become advocates who influence their communities, organizations, and governments to adopt sustainable practices and policies that protect our oceans for future generations.</p>
