                    <p class="animate delay-1">Plastic pollution has become one of the most pressing environmental issues facing our oceans today. With an estimated 8 million metric tons of plastic entering our oceans every year, marine ecosystems worldwide are facing unprecedented challenges. Unlike natural materials, plastics can persist in the environment for hundreds of years, breaking down into smaller pieces known as microplastics without fully biodegrading.</p>

From the smallest plankton to the largest whales, plastic is affecting marine life at every level of the food chain, disrupting natural processes that have evolved over millions of years.</p>
